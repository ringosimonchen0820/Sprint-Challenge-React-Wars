1. What is React JS and what problems does it try and solve? Support your answer with concepts introduced in class and from your personal research on the web.

    ReactJS is a UI library that allows the developer to create powerful, complex applications. Modern applications and websites are extremely complicated, interactive, and constantly updating with user content; React solves this problem by providing a smooth experience to the user and simple programming paradigm to the develper.
